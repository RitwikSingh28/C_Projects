## MailServer - A Minimalist Mail Server in C

This project is an ongoing implementation of a mail server written entirely in C, without using external libraries. The goal is to build a lightweight and efficient server from scratch, focusing on understanding and implementing email protocols like SMTP, POP3, and IMAP at a fundamental level.

---
### Why?

This project aims to explore:

1. The inner workings of email protocols and communication standards.
2. The nuances of low-level socket programming.
3. Writing performant C code for networked applications.
4. Avoiding external libraries to understand and implement core functionality from scratch.

### Challenges

Building a mail server without external libraries presents unique challenges:

- Handling low-level networking and protocol parsing.
- Managing email storage efficiently.
- Ensuring compatibility with modern email clients while staying lightweight.

These challenges make the project an excellent learning opportunity for anyone interested in network programming and protocols.
